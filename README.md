# hellocordova
 
This is my first Cordova application.  
This application has timer, interval timer, stopwatch and a counter, all tools useful for exmple when exercising.

## Intervaltimer

Set work and rest times and the timer will count down according to them for specified ammount of sets.  
_Timer will play a notification sound every second when there is three seconds left in either work or rest timer._
